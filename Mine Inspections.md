# Mine Inspection Data

There's a great deal of [mine inspection data](http://www.msha.gov/OpenGovernmentData/OGIMSHA.asp) provided by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Every time there's a mine collapse, it turns out that the mine has had a series of critical violations in the prior months, and everybody should have seen it coming. Well, can't we start *looking* for it to come?
